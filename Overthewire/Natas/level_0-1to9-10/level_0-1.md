Let's begin with the first step to finding your initial flag. After logging in to level 0 using the provided credentials, navigate to [http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/](http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/).

A common first step in basic CTF challenges is to right-click on the web page and select "View Page Source." This allows you to inspect the underlying HTML of the page. Go ahead and open the page sourceâ€”you should find your first flag there.

The flag will look something like this: `1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0jklmnopqrstuv` (Note: this is just an example; the actual flag will be different).

Once you have the flag, proceed to the next level using these credentials:

- **Username:** natas1  
- **URL:** [http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org)  
- **Password:** (the flag you just found)
