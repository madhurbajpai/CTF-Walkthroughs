## Welcome to the Next Level

You made it to the next level! Your enthusiasm to learn is commendable.

With the credentials obtained from the last level, you are now on a new web page. The page mentions that right-click is disabledâ€”what a great hint! This suggests you should look for keyboard shortcuts to inspect the page or view its source.

Here are some helpful shortcuts:
- **View Page Source:** `Ctrl + U`
- **Inspect Element:** `Ctrl + Shift + I`

Once you have found the flag, proceed to the next level using these credentials:

- **Username:** `natas2`
- **URL:** [http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org)
- **Password:** *(The flag you just found)*

Good luck!
