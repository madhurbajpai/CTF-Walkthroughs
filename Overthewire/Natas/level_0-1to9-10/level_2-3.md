Hope you tried solving the level before checking this walkthrough. Let's start with the basics: view the page source to look for clues. In the source, you'll find an image link. Click to open the imageâ€”unfortunately, it doesn't reveal anything useful.

However, notice the presence of a `/files` directory. Try appending `/files` to the URL in your browser. Inside, you'll see two files: a PNG image (the same one from the page source) and a `users.txt` file. Open `users.txt` to find the flag for the next level.

Once you have the flag, proceed to the next level with these credentials:

- **Username:** natas3  
- **URL:** [http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/](http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/)  
- **Password:** (the flag you just found)
